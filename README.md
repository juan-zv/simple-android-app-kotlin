# Overview

This is an app made in Android Studio. It involves logic written in Kotlin.

This app makes use of TextView, EditView and Buttom elements. The layout is made in XML and the logic or backend with Kotlin. 
It consists of a UI asking for a Name and Age to create a Greeting. The Greeting it's just a function which outputs the values entered in an arranged string.

I created this app to demonstrate my ability in Kotlin and OOP. This also shows little of my Adroid dev knowledge.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
